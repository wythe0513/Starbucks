## Starbucks

## Introduction
As a part of the couse of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), Data Science Nanodegree, I work on data sets which is kindly given by [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/) for the purpose of this course. This page is a summary of my findingns, if interested, code is [here](https://github.com/wythe0513/Starbucks).

## Data Description
1. `profile.json`(Rewards program users (17000 users x 5 fields))
2. `portfolio.json`(Offers sent during 30-day test period (10 offers x 6 fields))
3. `transcript.json`(Event log (306648 events x 4 fields))

## Files
1. Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.jpynb
2. visuals.py
3. customers.csv
4. group_1.csv
5. transcript.csv

## Purposes and approaches

The purpose of my exploration on those data is as follow;

1. To try to understand the customers and answer the question, what are the features of customers(age, income, genders etc.) who spend or not spend on Starbucks products during the test period. 
2. To try to find answers to the question, what kind of features of customers who view offers, if yes, which channels work more effectively to communicate with customers?
3. To try to find answers to the question, did offers are attractive enough to make them action, if yes, what offers are effective to what customers group?

In order to find answers of those questions, I made heuristic analysis through a comparing plots as well as machine learning analysis such as PCA(Principal Component Analysis) and supervised learnings by sklearn's SVM, Adaboost, Random Forest and also Logistic Regression classifiers.
